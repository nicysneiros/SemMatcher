As such, PSMs serve as reasoning building blocks (often collected in <em>libraries</em>) that can be assembled with a domain knowledge base to create a running system. <br><br>The PSM Librarian tab plugin for Prot&eacute;g&eacute; serves as a front-end interface between one of your domain projects and a set of PSM libraries (modeled with the <a href="http://www.cs.vu.nl/%7Eupml/" target="_blank">UPML</a> language). The PSM Librarian allows you to <strong>browse</strong> several PSM libraries in a uniform way and thus to make an informed selection of a PSM that suits your domain task and knowledge. The PSM Librarian then allows you to <strong>configure</strong> a PSM to fit the specifics of your domain application, by creating interactively a set of <em>mapping relations</em> between the entities of your domain and the input-output entities specified by the PSM. The PSM Librarian provides an integrated and simultaneous support for you to view and manage all three Prot&eacute;g&eacute; projects involved in the configuration process (domain, method and mappings). The PSM Librarian includes a<em> mapping interpreter</em> that processes those mapping relations to re-formulate your domain knowledge in terms that are appropriate for activating the PSM. <em>(Note that this version of the PSM Librarian tab does not support the actual activation of the configured PSM with case data.)</em>.<br><br><strong>Author and contact:</strong> <a href="mailto:crubezy@smi.stanford.edu">Monica Crub&eacute;zy</a><br><strong>Institution:</strong> Stanford University<br><strong>Documentation, Sample files and More: </strong><a href="http://protege.stanford.edu/plugins/psmtab/PSMTab.html">http://protege.stanford.edu/plugins/psmtab/PSMTab.html</a><br><br><strong>License:</strong> The PSM Librarian and its source code (like Prot&eacute;g&eacute;) are freely available, under the open source <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/MPL-1.1.html" target="_blank">Mozilla Public License.
