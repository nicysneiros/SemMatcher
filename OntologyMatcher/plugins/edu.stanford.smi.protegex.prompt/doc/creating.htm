an Operation<br>
<img src="images/header_line.gif" width="590" height="6"></h1>

<p>You can create a <a href="operations.htm">PROMPT operation</a> in one of two
ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>By going to the <a href="new_operations.htm"> New Operations</a> tab</li>
  <li>By opening the <a href="create_op_dialog.htm"> Create Operations</a> dialog box by clicking on the Create <img border="0" src="images/Create.gif" width="15" height="15">
    button at the <a href="suggestions.htm">Suggestions Tab</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In either case, once the operation has been set up, you can either perform it
immediately by clicking the Do It button, or you can add it to the ToDo list at
the <a href="suggestions.htm"> Suggestions Tab</a>.</p>
<p>To create an operation:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Make sure the Prompt tab is selected.</li>
  <li>Click the <a href="new_operations.htm">New Operations</a>
 tab<br>
    <i>
OR</i><br>
    Click the <a href="suggestions.htm"> Suggestions tab</a> and then click the Create <img border="0" src="images/Create.gif" width="15" height="15">
    button at the top right hand side of the ToDo list.
  </li>
  <li>
Select the operation you want from the operations menu. See <a href="operations.htm">PROMPT Operations</a> for a list of
    operations.<br>
<img border="0" src="images/creati1.gif" width="640" height="24"><br>
    If you have selected a merge operation you will see two arguments.
    (Arguments are the classes, slots, or instances on which you operate.) If
    you have selected a copy, move, or remove parent operation, you will see
    only one argument.
  </li>
  <li>
To change the ontolog(ies) for the argument, make a selection from
    the ontology menu(s). For instance, if you are merging two ontologies, and
    you have chosen a copy operation, you can use this menu to select the
    ontology from which you want to copy a frame.&nbsp;Or, if you want to merge
    frames that are now in the working ontology, select the working ontology
    from this menu.&nbsp;<br>
<img border="0" src="images/creati2.gif" width="251" height="27">
  </li>
  <li>
To select an argument for the operation, click the Add <img border="0" src="images/Add.gif" width="19" height="19">
    button.&nbsp;<br>
<img border="0" src="images/creati3.gif" width="253" height="50"><br>
 The Select Frame dialog box is displayed.<br>
    <img border="0" src="images/select_class.gif" width="328" height="263"><br>
    Click on the desired frame to highlight it and click OK.<br>
    <i>OR<br>
</i>If you are using the New Operations tab, you can highlight the frame you want in the Source Knowledge Bases area at the
    top and click the Load <img border="0" src="images/Load.gif" width="15" height="15"> 
button.  </li>
  <li>If there is a second argument, click the second Add <img border="0" src="images/Add.gif" width="19" height="19">
    button and select the desired frame from the dialog box<br>
    <i>OR<br>
    </i>In the New Operations tab, highlight the frame you want in the Source Knowledge Bases area at the
    top and click the Load <img border="0" src="images/Load.gif" width="15" height="15"> button.</li>
  <li>To set the options for the arguments, click the check boxes for the
    desired options. The available options depend on the operation you have
    chosen. See <a href="operations.htm"> PROMPT Operations</a> for more
    information.<br>
    <img border="0" src="images/creati4.gif" width="424" height="27"></li>
  <li>To perform the operation immediately, click <b>Do It</b>. In some cases,
    you may receive a warning dialog box. See <a href="perform_operation.htm">Performing an Operation</a>
    for more information.<br>
    When you perform an operation, the To Do list at the <a href="suggestions.htm">Suggestions Tab</a>,
    the <a href="conflicts_tab.htm">Conflicts Tab</a>, and the <a href="result_window.htm">Result Window</a>
    are all updated accordingly. If you view any of the other tabs, such as the
    Classes tab, the frame incorporated by your operation will be visible.</li>
  <li>For <a href="merge_mode.htm">merge</a> and <a href="move_frames_mode.htm">moving
    frames</a> modes, to add the operation to the To Do list at the <a href="suggestions.htm">Suggestions Tab</a>,
    click <b>ToDo list</b>. The operation will be listed on the To Do list, with
    the name of the operation in <b>bold</b> to indicate that it has been
    created or modified. You can perform this operation later by going to the <a href="suggestions.htm"> Suggestions Tab</a>,
    highlighting the operation, and clicking <b>Do It</b>.  </li>
