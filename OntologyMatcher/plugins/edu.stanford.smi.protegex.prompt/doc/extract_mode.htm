<p>Extract mode allows you to save a part of your ontology in a new project. You
may want to do this for various
reasons: to use some subset of the knowledge base in a different project,
to distribute only part of your ontology, to debug a smaller portion of
it, and so on. The extracted ontology may be saved in a new project or incorporated
as part of another, existing project. The original ontology is left unchanged.</p>

<p>In extract mode, the <a href="prompt_tab.htm"> Prompt Tab</a> has two subtabs:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The Suggestions Tab</li>
      <li>The New Operations Tab
      </li>
    </ul>
<p>The Conflicts tab does not appear in extract mode.</p>
<p>Via these tabs, PROMPT guides you through the extract process, making
suggestions based on the frames you have already copied.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The Suggestions Tab</h2>
<p><a href="suggestions.htm">The Suggestions Tab</a> contains a list of
suggested <a href="operations.htm">operations</a>. When you first begin an
extract, this list is empty.
As you make changes, PROMPT considers the structure of the ontology around the arguments to
the latest operations and proposes other operations that you should perform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In extract mode, the PROMPT tab allows you to pick and choose frames and
then copy them into your working project. You can choose a frame and copy
everything related to the frame (specifically the transitive closure of what the frame
refers to, except for the subclasses—otherwise you'll always get the whole
knowledge base). Alternatively, you can copy frames one by one. In that
case, PROMPT will show you the list of referenced frames that you have
not yet copied. For example, if you have copied a class, PROMPT will list any of
its superclasses that have not yet been copied.</p>
<p>The possible extract operations are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>copy a frame from the source ontology</li>
</ul>
<p>Frames that have been copied are marked with a mapped <img border="0" src="images/Mapped.gif" width="15" height="16">
icon in <a href="result_window.htm">The Result Window</a> and <a href="source_bases.htm">The Source Knowledge Bases Window</a>.</p>
<h2>The New Operations Tab</h2>
<p><a href="new_operations.htm">The New Operations Tab</a> is a working area
that shows your source ontologies and allows you to
create new operations. Icons show which frames from the source ontologies have
already been incorporated into the working project.</p>
