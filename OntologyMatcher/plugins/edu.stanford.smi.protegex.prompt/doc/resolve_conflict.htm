<p>As you work, conflicts may arise because of operations you
have performed. The <a href="conflicts_tab.htm">Conflicts tab</a> suggests ways to resolve
these conflicts. For example, if a class has a
slot that references a class that currently does not exist in the working
project, this will show up as a conflict. When there are conflicts, the tab name
is highlighted in red.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To resolve a conflict:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Click on the conflict to select it. You can only resolve one conflict at a
    time.</li>
  <li>If more than one solution is shown at the bottom of the Conflicts tab,
    click the desired solution to select it.</li>
  <li>Click Do It to perform the operation.</li>
</ol>

<p>Based on your knowledge of the ontolgie(s), you may decide to resolve the
conflict in some other way. For example, you can <a href="creating.htm">create</a>
your own operation to resolve the conflict.</p>
