<h1><img src="images/serving_nerd.gif" width="48" height="48">   &nbsp;The New
Operations Tab<br>
<img src="images/header_line.gif" width="590" height="6"></h1>

<p>The New Operations tab shows you your source ontologie(s) and allows you to
create new operations, which you can either perform immediately or add to the
ToDo list at the <a href="suggestions.htm">Suggestions Tab</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The New Operations tab includes the following areas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A source knowledge bases area where you can view, search, and select
    frames</li>
  <li>A create operations area, where you can create a new operation</li>
  <li>Operations buttons, which allow you to choose whether to perform an
    operation immediately, or to add it to the ToDo list at the <a href="suggestions.htm"> Suggestions Tab</a></li>
</ul>

<p><img border="0" src="images/creating_op_tab.gif" width="574" height="505"></p>

<h2><a name="source bases"></a>The Source Knowledge Bases Area</h2>

<p>The Source Knowledge Bases area shows you the original ontologie(s)
that you are incorporating into your working project.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The exact contents of the area depend on the mode in which you are working:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you are <a href="merge_mode.htm"> merging</a> ontologies, the ontology
    first selected during <a href="initialize_prompt.htm">initialization</a> is on the left.&nbsp;</li>
  <li> If you are <a href="extract_mode.htm"> extracting</a> or <a href="move_frames_mode.htm">moving
    frames</a>, you will see only one
ontology.</li>
</ul>

<p>The New Operations window is not available for <a href="compare_mode.htm">compare
mode</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Tabs allow you to choose whether to view classes, slots, or frames. You can
navigate through the ontologies in the same way you would navigate through the
Class, Slot, or Instance tab. You can also search for a frame by typing all
or part of its name in the search bar and then clicking the Find <img border="0" src="images/Find.gif" width="16" height="15">
button. Additional functionality is provided by the <a href="#buttons">source
buttons</a> and the <a href="#icons">source icons</a>.</p>

<p>Once you have highlighted a frame, you can load it into the create operations
area by clicking the Load <img border="0" src="images/Load.gif" width="15" height="15">button. See the <a href="#create">Create
Operations Area</a> on this page for further information.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> The Source Knowledge Bases area at the New Operations tab is
similar to the <a href="source_bases.htm">Source Knowledge Bases Window</a>,
accessed by clicking the Source <img border="0" src="images/Source.gif" width="15" height="15"> button
in the <a href="suggestions.htm">Suggestions Tab</a>. However, the area in the
New Operations tab is more flexible, allowing you to navigate directly through
the hierarchy of the incorporated ontologies without reference to the selection
in the <a href="suggestions.htm"> Suggestions Tab</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="buttons"></a>Source Buttons</h3>

<p>Buttons at the top of each pane allow you to view information about the
highlighted frame:</p>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="15%" valign="top"><img border="0" src="images/View.gif" width="15" height="15"></td>
    <td width="85%"><b>V(iew)
button:</b> Click this button to open the Class, Slot, or Instance Form for the highlighted
      frame. Because you are viewing the original ontology, you cannot edit the
      frame from this version of the form. However, you may be able to access
      additional information, such as viewing the slots of a selected class.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
      <td width="11%"> <img border="0" src="images/BackReferences.gif" width="13" height="13"> </td>
      <td width="89%"><font size="3"><b>Back-references button:</b> Click this
        button to view all the objects in the original ontology that reference the highlighted
        frame.&nbsp;</font></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h3><a name="icons"></a>Source Icons</h3>

<p>Special icons to the right of a frame indicate its status:</p>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="15%" valign="top"><img border="0" src="images/Mapped.gif" width="15" height="16"></td>
    <td width="85%">The frame has been <b>mapped</b> (merge, extract, or compare
      ontologies). A mapped frame has been copied in some way into the working
      project, for example, by merging, copying, or mapping after a compare. It
      has not been altered in the original ontology.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="15%" valign="top"><img border="0" src="images/Local.gif" width="15" height="16"></td>
    <td width="85%">The frame is <b>local</b> (move from included to including
      ontology). A local frame has been moved from the original ontology to the
      working ontology. In this case, the original ontology has been
      altered.&nbsp;</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h2><a name="create"></a>The Create Operations Area</h2>

<p>The Create Operations area allows you to create a new prompt operation and perform the operation.
For <a href="merge_mode.htm">merge</a> and <a href="move_frames_mode.htm">moving
frames</a> modes, you can also defer the operation by adding it to the To Do list in the <a href="suggestions.htm">Suggestions Tab</a>.</p>

<p><b>Note</b>: A similar dialog appears when you click the Create <img border="0" src="images/Create.gif" width="15" height="15">
button at the <a href="suggestions.htm">Suggestions Tab</a>.
However, the dialog at the New Operations tab has additional functionality that allows you to use the information in the top
half to load frames.</p>

<p>The Create Operations area contains the following sections:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A menu allows you to choose the operation you want to create.
    Operations may involve classes, slots, or instances. Available operations
    depend on the mode (<a href="merge_mode.htm">merge</a>, <a href="extract_mode.htm">extract</a>,
    or <a href="move_frames_mode.htm">moving frames</a>) in which
    you are working. See <a href="operations.htm">PROMPT Operations</a> for more
    information.</li>
  <li>Menu(s) that allow you to choose the source ontologie(s) for the
    operation. For instance, if you are merging two ontologies, and you have
    chosen a copy operation, you can use this menu to select the ontology you
    want to copy a frame from.</li>
  <li>One or two entry bars allow you to choose the class(es), slot(s), or
    instance(s) you want as arguments to the operation. Merge operations have two
    arguments; all other operations have only one argument. The buttons to the
    right of the entry bar allow you to view, choose, or remove the argument as
    follows:
    <ul>
      <li>The View <img border="0" src="images/View.gif" width="15" height="15"> button allows you to
        view the Class, Slot, or Instance Form for the named frame. The View
        button is grayed out unless a frame is selected.</li>
      <li>The Load <img border="0" src="images/Load.gif" width="15" height="15"> button allows you to
        load the frame highlighted in the <a href="#source bases">Source
        Knowledge Bases area</a> into the argument entry bar. If there is no
        frame selected in the Source Knowledge Bases area, or if the frame type
        and the operation do not match (e.g., if classes are shown above, while <b>copy
        slot</b> is selected), this button is grayed out.</li>
      <li>The Add <img border="0" src="images/Add.gif" width="19" height="19">
        button displays a Select Frame dialog box, where you can select a frame
        to load into the argument entry bar.</li>
      <li>The Remove <img border="0" src="images/Remove.gif" width="19" height="19"> button removes the
        frame from the argument entry bar. The Remove button is grayed out
        unless a frame is selected.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Check boxes allow you to select the options for the operation.
    Options are described in <a href="operations.htm"> PROMPT Operations</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="operations buttons"></a>Operations Buttons</h2>
<p>Two buttons at the bottom of the New Operations tab allow you to choose how
to perform the operation:</p>
<ul>
  <li> <b>Do It</b> immediately performs the specified operation, with the
    selected arguments and options</li>
  <li><b>ToDo list</b> adds the operation to the To Do list
    at the <a href="suggestions.htm">Suggestions Tab</a> (<a href="merge_mode.htm">merge</a>
    and <a href="move_frames_mode.htm">moving frames</a> modes only).</li>
</ul>
<p>Whenever an operation is performed, the ToDo list at the <a href="suggestions.htm">Suggestions Tab</a>
and the <a href="conflicts_tab.htm">Conflicts Tab</a> are updated appropriately.</p>
