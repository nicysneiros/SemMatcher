Operation Dialog<br>

<p>The Create Operation dialog allows you to create a new prompt operation and
either perform the operation or add it to the To Do list in the <a href="suggestions.htm">Suggestions Tab</a>.</p>

<p>You can view the Create Operation dialog by clicking the Create <img border="0" src="images/Create.gif" width="15" height="15"> button in
    the ToDo list at the <a href="suggestions.htm">Suggestions Tab</a>.</p>

<p><b>Note</b>: A similar dialog appears at the bottom of the <a href="new_operations.htm">New Operations Tab</a>.
However, the <a href="new_operations.htm">New Operations Tab</a>
has additional functionality that allows you to use the information in the top
half to load frames.</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/create_op_dialog.gif" width="645" height="186"></p>

<p>The dialog box contains the following sections:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A menu which allows you to choose the operation you want to create.
    Operations may involve classes, slots, or instances. Available operations
    depend on the mode (merge, extract, move from included, or compare) in which
    you are working. See <a href="operations.htm">PROMPT Operations</a> for more
    information.</li>
  <li>One or two entry bars where you can choose the class(es), slot(s), or
    instance(s) as arguments to the operation. Merge operations have two
    arguments; all other operations have only one argument. To select or change
    an argument, click the Add <img border="0" src="images/Add.gif" width="19" height="19">
    button.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Check boxes that allow you to select the options for the operation.
    Options are described in <a href="operations.htm"> PROMPT Operations</a>.</li>
  <li>Buttons that allow you to <b>Do It</b>, which performs the operation
    immediately; or <b>ToDo list,</b> which adds the operation to the To Do list
    at the <a href="suggestions.htm">Suggestions Tab</a>.</li>
</ul>
