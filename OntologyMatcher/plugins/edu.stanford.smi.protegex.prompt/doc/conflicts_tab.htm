<p>The Conflicts Tab shows conflicts that have arisen because of operations you
have performed, and suggests ways to resolve them. For example, if a class has a
slot that references a class that currently does not exist in the working
project, this will show up as a conflict. When there are conflicts, the tab name
is highlighted in red.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Conflicts tab has three areas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The Current Conflicts list, which lists the conflicts.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>The Reasons pane, which explains the reason for the highlighted conflict.</li>
  <li>The Suggested solutions list, which lists possible solutions to the
    highlighted conflict.</li>
</ul>
<p>To resolve a conflict, you can select the conflict, select one of the
operations in the Suggested solutions list, and then click the Do It button.</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/conflict_tab.gif" width="572" height="525"></p>

<p>The meaning of the operations, arguments, and parameters shown in the
Suggested solutions list are identical to those shown in the <a href="suggestions.htm">Suggestions
tab</a>. If you want to modify the parameters, you cannot do it directly from
here. Instead, you would create a new operation from the <a href="suggestions.htm">Suggestions
tab</a> or the <a href="new_operations.htm">Creating Operation</a> tab, and
then either perform the operation or add it to the To Do list.</p>
