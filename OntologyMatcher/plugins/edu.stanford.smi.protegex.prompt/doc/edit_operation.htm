<p>For <a href="merge_mode.htm">merge</a> and <a href="move_frames_mode.htm">moving
frames</a> modes, suggested operations are shown on the To Do list at the <a href="suggestions.htm">Suggestions
tab</a>. You can edit operations on this list, for example, to change the
options, as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Select the operation you want to change by clicking on it. You can only
    edit one operation at a time.</li>
  <li>Click the View <img border="0" src="images/View.gif" width="15" height="15"> button at the top
    right of the To Do list to open the <a href="edit_dialog.htm">Edit Operation Dialog Box</a>.<br>
    <img border="0" src="images/edit_dialog.gif" width="645" height="186"></li>
  <li>To change the operation, select a new operation from the operations menu
    at the top. Changing the operation will remove the original operation from
    the To Do list, replacing it with the operation you create.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>To change an argument for the operation, click the Add <img border="0" src="images/Add.gif" width="19" height="19">
    button. The Select Frame dialog box is displayed.<br>
    <img border="0" src="images/select_class.gif" width="328" height="263"><br>
    Click on the desired frame to highlight it and click OK.<br>
    <b>Note:</b> If you want to select an argument from a different ontology,
    first change the ontology on the menu immediately above the Argument entry
    box.</li>
  <li>To change the options for the arguments, click the check boxes for the
    desired options. The available options depend on the operation you have
    chosen. See <a href="operations.htm"> PROMPT Operations</a> for more
    information.</li>
  <li>To perform the operation immediately, click <b>Do It</b>.&nbsp; In some
    cases, you may receive a warning dialog box. See <a href="perform_operation.htm">Performing an Operation</a>
    for more information.<br>
    When you perform an operation, the To Do list at the <a href="suggestions.htm">Suggestions Tab</a>,
    the <a href="conflicts_tab.htm">Conflicts Tab</a>, and the <a href="result_window.htm">Result Window</a>
    are all updated accordingly. If you view any of the other tabs, such as the
    Classes tab, the frame incorporated by your operation will be visible.</li>
  <li>To add the operation to the To Do list at the <a href="suggestions.htm"> Suggestions Tab</a>,
    click <b>ToDo list</b>. The operation will be listed on the To Do list, with
    the name of the operation in <b>bold</b> to indicate that it has been
    created or modified. You can perform this operation later by going to the <a href="suggestions.htm"> Suggestions Tab</a>,
    highlighting the operation, and clicking <b>Do It</b>.
