Frames Mode<br>

<p>
Moving frames mode allows you to move frames from an included to an including project.
This is the only mode that alters the original ontology as well as the target
ontology. It is a good idea to make copies of both the including and included
ontologies before you enable moving frames mode.</p>
Prot&eacute;g&eacute; facilitates reuse and development of ontologies through
the project-inclusion mechanism. One project can include one or several
other projects and reuse all frames from the included projects.&nbsp; The
"moving frames" mode of the PROMPT tab allows you to move the frames from the included project into the including
one, thus altering both.&nbsp;
<p>In moving frames mode, the <a href="prompt_tab.htm"> Prompt Tab</a> has two
subtabs:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The Conflicts Tab</li>
      <li>The New Operations Tab
      </li>
    </ul>
<p><a href="suggestions.htm">The Suggestions tab</a> does not appear in moving frames mode.</p>
<p>Via these tabs, PROMPT guides you through the moving frames process,
identifying conflicts and proposing conflict-resolution strategies.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The Conflicts Tab</h2>
<p><a href="conflicts_tab.htm">The Conflicts Tab</a> contains a running list of
conflicts to help you sever all the links from the included project to the including
one, to
ensure that nothing in the including project depends on the included one.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/includ1.gif" width="579" height="336"></p>
<p> When moving a frame, you can choose everything
that must be moved in order for the projects to remain consistent. An included
project should always stand on its own, therefore, no frame that remains in the included
project should depend on a frame that has been moved to the including project. You can also
choose to perform the process frame-by-frame.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you first start moving frames, the Conflicts tab is empty. When
conflicts arise, the tab name
is highlighted in red.</p>
<h2>The New Operations Tab</h2>
<p><a href="new_operations.htm">The New Operations Tab</a> is a working area
that shows your source ontology and allows you to
create new operations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The possible moving frames operations are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>move a frame from the included ontology to the working (including)
    ontology</li>
</ul>
<p>Frames that have been moved to the including (local) ontology are marked with a local <img border="0" src="images/Local.gif" width="15" height="16">
icon in <a href="result_window.htm">the Result Window</a>. Frames that are still
part of the included ontology are marked with a color, such as blue, to show
their origin.</p>
