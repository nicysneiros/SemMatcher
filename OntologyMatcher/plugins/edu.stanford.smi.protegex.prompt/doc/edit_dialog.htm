Operation Dialog Box<br>
<img src="images/header_line.gif" width="590" height="6"></h1>

<p>For <a href="merge_mode.htm">merge</a> and <a href="move_frames_mode.htm">moving
frames</a> modes, the Edit Operation dialog box allows you to edit a suggested
operation on the&nbsp; To Do list at the <a href="suggestions.htm">Suggestions
tab</a>. You can access this dialog box by clicking the View <img border="0" src="images/View.gif" width="15" height="15">
icon at the top right of the To Do list.</p>

<p><img border="0" src="images/edit_dialog.gif" width="645" height="186"></p>

<p>The following things can be edited from this dialog box:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The operations menu at the top allows you to choose a different operation
    from the list of operations available for the current mode. For more
    information, see <a href="operations.htm">Available PROMPT Operations</a>.</li>
  <li>The ontology menu(s) allow you to choose the ontologie(s) for the argument,
    for example, to set the source ontology for a copy operation in <a href="merge_mode.htm">merge</a>
    mode.</li>
  <li>The frame entry bar allows you to choose the frame(s) you want as
    arguments to the operation. You cannot type a name in this bar; you must
    select it using the Add <img border="0" src="images/Add.gif" width="19" height="19"> button.</li>
  <li>The option check boxes allow you to change the options for the operation.
    This is probably the most frequent reason for editing an existing
    suggestion. For more information about options, see <a href="operations.htm">Available PROMPT Operations</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you edit a suggestion, the old suggestion is deleted from the list and
replaced with the new one. For this reason, you would seldom want to change the
operation or the arguments. (For a merge operation, you might want to change one
of the arguments, leaving the other one untouched.) If you want to create a new
suggestion, use the <a href="create_op_dialog.htm">Create Operation Dialog Box</a>,
accessed using the Create <img border="0" src="images/Create.gif" width="15" height="15"> button at the
upper right of the To Do list. If you want to delete a suggestion, use the
Delete <img border="0" src="images/Delete.gif" width="16" height="15"> button.</p>
