<h1><img src="images/serving_nerd.gif" width="48" height="48">   &nbsp;The
Suggestions Tab<br>
<img src="images/header_line.gif" width="590" height="6"></h1>

<p>The Suggestions Tab shows a list of frames from the sources ontologie(s) and
suggests an action for each frame shown. A pane at the bottom displays the Protégé
heuristics for the suggestion.&nbsp;The Suggestions Tab is only available for
the <a href="merge_mode.htm">merge</a> and <a href="move_frames_mode.htm">moving
frames</a> modes.</p>

<p> When you begin a new merge project, this list
only contains classes. As you modify your project, the To Do list is updated to
include other frames, such as slots, that are logically necessary for project
completeness and consistency.&nbsp;When you begin a moving frames project, the
list is empty.
As you make changes, PROMPT considers the structure of the ontology around the arguments to
the latest operations and proposes other operations that you should perform. For
example, if you have merged two classes, creating a new class which combines all
of their slots, PROMPT may suggest merging similar slots as well.</p>

<p>Using the Suggestions Tab, you can:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="edit_operation.htm">edit</a> suggestions and change their parameters</li>
  <li><a href="creating.htm">add</a> suggestions to the list</li>
  <li><a href="remove_operation.htm">remove</a> suggestions from the list</li>
  <li><a href="perform_operation.htm">perform</a> the operations on the To Do list</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also modify and create suggestions using the <a href="new_operations.htm">New
Operations</a> tab.&nbsp;</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/suggest_tab.gif" width="577" height="526"></p>

<p>The To Do list has the following columns: <a href="#name">Name</a>, <a href="#arguments">Arg</a>, and
<a href="#params">Params</a>. These
display the following information.</p>

<h3><a name="name"></a>Name</h3>

<p>Gives the name of the suggested <a href="operations.htm">operation</a>. If Protégé supplied the
suggestion, the name is in normal type. If you have created or edited the suggestion,
the name is in <b>bold</b>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Operations include merge, copy, move, and remove parent operations. See <a href="operations.htm"> PROMPT Operations</a>
for more information on the individual operations.</p>

<h3><a name="arguments"></a>Args</h3>
<p>Shows the name of the frame(s) that are arguments to the suggested operation.
Copy, Move, and Remove Parent operations have one argument; merge operations have two.
If you are extracting or including an ontology, only copy or move operations are
possible, so you will see only one column of arguments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For <a href="merge_mode.htm">merge</a> mode, frame names are color-coded
according to their source ontology. The first ontology that was loaded in the
initialization dialog is in <font color="#FF0000">red</font>; the second
ontology is in <font color="#0000FF">blue</font>.&nbsp; In addition, any Alias
you chose during initialization is shown. If you copy frames to the working
ontology, the color-coding and Alias are retained; if you merge frames, this
information is not preserved.</p>
<h3><a name="params"></a>Params</h3>
<p>Shows the parameters (options) selected for the <a href="operations.htm">operation</a>. These options
can be modified by highlighting the suggestion and clicking the View <img border="0" src="images/View.gif" width="15" height="15">
button. See <a href="operations.htm"> PROMPT Operations</a>
for more information on the individual options.</p>
<h3><a name="buttons"></a>Suggestion Buttons</h3>
<p>The buttons at the upper right of the Suggestions tab allow you to modify the
list:</p>
