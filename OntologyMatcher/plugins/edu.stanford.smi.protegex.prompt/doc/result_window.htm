<h1><img src="images/serving_nerd.gif" width="48" height="48">  &nbsp;The Result
Window<br>
<img src="images/header_line.gif" width="590" height="6"></h1>

<p>The Result Window at the right of the <a href="prompt_tab.htm">Prompt Tab</a>
shows the current state of the working ontology.&nbsp;Tabs allow you to view
classes, slots, or instances.</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/result_window.gif" width="377" height="239"></p>

<h2>Result Frame Codes</h2>

<p>The status of merged, copied, or moved frames is indicated as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Merged frames appear as normal frames, with no suffix or
    color-coding.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>If you are working in <a href="merge_mode.htm">merge</a> mode, copied
    frames indicate their source ontology in two ways:
    <ul>
      <li>a suffix (selected during the <font size="3"><a href="initialize_prompt.htm">initialization</a>
        </font>process) is appended to the frame name to indicate the source
        ontology; suffixes can be <a href="remove_suffix.htm"> removed</a> at the end of a session using the
<b> RemoveSuffixes</b>
option on the Prompt Menu.</li>
      <li>the frame is highlighted in the color associated with its ontology.
        Usually, the ontology first selected during <font size="3"><a href="initialize_prompt.htm">initialization</a>
        </font> is red and the other ontology is blue.&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>If you are working in <a href="extract_mode.htm">extract</a> mode, copied
    frames appear as normal frames, with no suffix or color-coding.</li>
  <li>If you are working in <a href="move_frames_mode.htm">moving frames</a>
    mode, frames that have been moved are indicated with a local <img border="0" src="images/Local.gif" width="15" height="16">
    icon, to indicate they are now part of the working project.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Result Buttons</h2>

<p>The buttons at the top right of the window allow you to view the following
information:</p>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="15%" valign="top"><img border="0" src="images/View.gif" width="15" height="15"></td>
    <td width="85%"><b>V(iew)
button:</b> Click this button to open the Class, Slot, or Instance Form for the highlighted
      frame. This may be useful, for example, to see the slots for a merged
      class.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
      <td width="11%"> <img border="0" src="images/BackReferences.gif" width="13" height="13"> </td>
      <td width="89%"><font size="3"><b>Back-references button:</b> Click this
        button to view all the objects in the working ontology that reference the highlighted
        frame.&nbsp;</font></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="7%" valign="top"><img border="0" src="images/Source.gif" width="15" height="15"></td>
    <td width="93%"><b>Show Sources button:</b> Displays the <a href="source_bases.htm"> Source Knowledge
      Bases</a>  window, which shows the source ontologie(s), and indicates which
      frames have been incorporated into the working project.&nbsp;When a frame
      is highlighted in the Result window, its source frame(s) are highlighted
      in the Source Knowledge Bases window.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h2>Temporary Frames</h2>

<p>When you are creating a new ontology from your source ontologie(s), you may
incorporate (copy, merge, or move) frames that have as parents other frames that
are not yet included in the working ontology. Prot&eacute;g&eacute; keeps track
of the original relationships in the source ontologies. If you incorporate a
parent later, the correct relationship will be preserved.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Similarly, you may incorporate a frame that references another
not-yet-included frame in the source ontology. In order to maintain internal
relationships and to be able to restore them if a frame is incorporated later, Prot&eacute;g&eacute;
creates &quot;dummy&quot; frames for frames that are referenced but not
incorporated. These frames are created as subframes of the system class
:DUMMY-FRAMES. They will show up in the <a href="conflicts_tab.htm">Conflicts tab</a>
as conflicts to be resolved.&nbsp;</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/dummy.gif" width="331" height="326"> <img border="0" src="images/dummy_conflict.gif" align="top" width="343" height="175"></p>

<p align="left">When you incorporate the original frame from the source
ontology, the corresponding &quot;dummy&quot; frame is automatically removed.
However, if you finish the project and <a href="remove_suffix.htm">remove
suffixes</a> without ever incorporating the relevant frame, the
&quot;dummy&quot; frame remains part of the project.&nbsp;</p>
