<h1><img src="images/serving_nerd.gif" width="48" height="48"> &nbsp;The Image
Table<br>
<img src="images/header_line.gif" width="590" height="6"></h1>

<p>For <a href="compare_mode.htm">compare mode</a>, the Prompt tab consists of a single window, the Image
table, which shows all the frames in the two compared projects and lists the
similarities and differences. This interface is informational only; you cannot
edit or change any project from the Image Table.</p>

<p>The Image Table consists of columns listing information about the
relationship of frames in the old and new ontologies. In addition, the Image
Table buttons allow you to view, but not edit, further information about the
highlighted row. You can use the information in the Image Table, along with your
own knowledge of your project, to determine what changes have been made between
the versions.</p>

<p><b>Note: </b>If you are familiar with UNIX, note that the functionality is intended to be similar to
the UNIX tool <code>diff</code>, but is based on the ontological structure of the project,
rather than the line-by-line difference between the files. Additional
information is given to indicate the heuristics Prot&eacute;g&eacute; has used
to make the determination.</p>

<h2>Image Table Columns</h2>

<p>The Image Table shows the result of the compare operation. The first two
columns show the frames in the old and new versions. If there are frames in both
columns, the other columns show the relationship between the two frames and the
reason they have been identified. If there is a frame in only one of the first
two columns, the other columns tell whether that frame has been removed or
added.</p>

<h3>f1</h3>
<p>This column lists all the frames in the old version of the ontology. Frames
that have been changed in some way (added, removed, renamed, etc.) are displayed
at the top of the list. If there is no corresponding frame in f2, the frame has
been removed.</p>

<h3>f2</h3>
<p>This column lists all the frames in the new version of the ontology. Frames
that have been changed in some way (added, removed, renamed, etc.) are displayed
at the top of the list. If there is no corresponding frame f1, the frame has
been added.</p>

<h3>renamed</h3>

<p>A Yes in this column indicates that Prot&eacute;g&eacute; suggests that the
two frames in columns f1 and f2 correspond to each other, except for a name
change. This correspondence is based on simple heuristics, described in the
rename explanation column.</p>

<h3>operation</h3>

<p>The operation column summarizes how the frames in columns f1 and f2 are
related. If there are frames in both columns, then the identification is Map. If
there is a frame in f1 but none in f2, then the action has been to Remove the
frame. If there is no frame in f1, but one in f2, then the action was Add.</p>

<h3>map level</h3>
<p>Indicates how closely the frames in f1 and f2 match. The levels are as
follows:</p>
<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="24%"><b>Level</b></td>
    <td width="76%"><b>Description</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="24%" valign="top">Changed</td>
    <td width="76%">Some essential attribute has changed.&nbsp;
      <p>Examples:<br>
      A class which has a different number of slots in the two versions<br>
      A class which has the same number of slots in both versions, but has at
      least one slot which is neither matches nor is isomorphic to any slot in
      the changed class.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Changed frames are strongly different in the two versions and should be
      looked at for version reconciliation.</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="24%" valign="top">Isomorphic</td>
    <td width="76%">The frames in the two versions are matched, but there is
      some difference in how they are presented or structured in the two
      versions.&nbsp;
      <p>Examples:<br>
      Two frames that have the same names and the same direct information, but
      now have different metaslots; in this case, they would have different
      template slots and would look different.<br>
      Two classes that have the same names, the same number of slots, but there
      is a slot that has a different name in the two versions.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Isomorphic frames are superficially different in the two versions, and
      you may want to examine them to verify their similarity.</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="24%" valign="top">Unchanged</td>
    <td width="76%">The frame name and all attributes are unchanged.
      <p>There is no reason to examine Unchanged frames.</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>If one of the columns is blank, no explanation is given.</p>

<h3>rename explanation</h3>

<p>If there is a Yes in the renamed column, gives the reason Prot&eacute;g&eacute;
suggests that a frame in the new ontology is a renaming of a frame with a
different name in the old ontology.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>operation explanation</h3>

<p>If the frames are Changed or Isomorphic, gives the reason.</p>

<h2>Image Table Buttons</h2>
<p>The buttons at the upper right of the Image table allow you to view more
information about a highlighted item:</p>
<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="7%" valign="top"><img border="0" src="images/View.gif" width="15" height="15"></td>
    <td width="93%"><b>View button: </b>Displays a view-only version of the
      Class, Slot, or Instance form for the selected frame(s). No changes can be
      made.</td>
  </tr>

    <td width="7%" valign="top"><img border="0" src="images/BackReferences.gif" width="13" height="13"></td>
    <td width="93%"><b>Back-references button:</b> For each ontology, displays
      the list <font size="3">of all the frames in the original ontology that reference the highlighted

      Bases window</a>, which shows the source ontologies. The frames which are
      highlighted in the Image table are also highlighted here.&nbsp;</td>
