<img src="images/header_line.gif" width="590" height="6"></h1>

<p>The Prompt tab allows you to view the ontologies you are merging, including,
extracting, or comparing, and to choose the operations to perform on all or part
of these ontologies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To view the Prompt Tab in your project, you must have PROMPT <a href="install_prompt.htm">installed</a>
in your Protégé plugins folder and you must <a href="activate_prompt.htm">activate</a>
the Prompt Tab in your project. Before the Prompt Tab is <a href="initialize_prompt.htm">initialized</a>,
it is just one giant button:&nbsp;</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/prompt_uninit.gif" width="262" height="139"></p>

<p>Clicking anywhere in this area will start the <a href="initialize_prompt.htm">initialization</a>
process, which
allows you to choose which ontologies you want to work with, and the actions you
will use.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Once the Prompt Tab has been initialized, it displays a number of subtabs
related to the PROMPT mode you have chosen.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For <a href="merge_mode.htm">merge</a>, <a href="extract_mode.htm">extract</a>, and
<a href="move_frames_mode.htm">moving frames</a> modes, an interface similar to
the following will appear:</p>

<p><img border="0" src="images/prompt_init.gif" width="940" height="566"></p>

<p> The area on the left-hand side has two or three subtabs:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="suggestions.htm">The Suggestions Tab</a> (<a href="merge_mode.htm">merge</a> and <a href="move_frames_mode.htm">moving
frames</a>  modes only) : Shows a list of frames from the sources ontologie(s) and a
    suggested action for each frame shown. The Suggestions list is updated
    according to the operations you perform. A pane at the bottom displays the
    Protégé heuristics for the suggestion. Clicking Do It performs the
    suggested action for every highlighted frame.</li>
  <li><a href="conflicts_tab.htm">The Conflicts Tab</a>  (optional): Shows a list of &quot;conflicts&quot; that need to
    be resolved to make the project logically complete. For example, if a class
    has a slot that references a class that currently does not exist in the
    working project, this will show up as a conflict.&nbsp; The Conflicts list
    is updated according to the operations you perform. A pane at the bottom
    gives suggested solutions for the conflict. When there are conflicts, the
    title of the tab is red .</li>
  <li><a href="new_operations.htm">The New Operations Tab</a>: Shows the source ontologie(s) and
    allows you to create new PROMPT operations. You can perform the operations from this pane, or add them to the
    To Do list at the Suggestions Tab.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="result_window.htm">Result Window</a> on the right-hand side allows you to view the current state of your
working ontology. You can view classes, slots, or instances. This information is
part of the view you would get by clicking the Class, Slot, or Instances Tab. It
is duplicated here for convenience.</p>
<p>See the individual pages for more information on each area.</p>

<p>If you are using <a href="compare_mode.htm">compare mode</a>, you will see
the <a href="image_table.htm">image table</a> instead. See <a href="image_table.htm">The Image Table</a>
for more information.</p>
