an Operation<br>
<img src="images/header_line.gif" width="590" height="6"></h1>

<p> You can perform operations as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Create the operation using the <a href="new_operations.htm"> New Operations Tab</a>
    or the <a href="create_op_dialog.htm"> Create Operation Dialog Box</a>.<br>
    OR<br>
    For <a href="merge_mode.htm">merge</a>  and <a href="move_frames_mode.htm">moving
frames</a>  modes, highlight the operation(s) you want to perform in the To Do
    list at the <a href="suggestions.htm">Suggestions
tab</a>. To
    highlight more than one operation, hold down the Ctrl key or the Shift key
    as you click.<br>
    OR<br>
    Edit an existing operation on the ToDo list using the <a href="edit_dialog.htm">Edit Operation Dialog Box</a>.</li>
  <li>Click Do It at the bottom of the window.</li>
  <li>If you are performing a merge operation and the names,
    documentation strings, or roles of the two frames are different, you may be
    prompted to choose the value for the merged class.<br>

    <img border="0" src="images/chooserole.gif" width="357" height="258"><br>
    To use a value from the source ontology, select the value. To enter a new
    name or documentation string, select <b>Other</b> and then type. Then click
    OK.<br>
    If you know you want to consistently use the values from one of the source
    ontologies, you can set that as the preferred ontology. This setting can be
    changed at any time without affecting previously merged frames. See <a href="configure_prompt.htm">Internal Prompt Configuration</a>
    for more information.</li>
  <li>If one of the arguments to your suggested operation(s) has already been
    incorporated into the working ontology, you will get a warning dialog box.<br>
    <img border="0" src="images/warning.gif" width="284" height="133"><br>
    To continue with the operation, click OK. You can merge or copy any source
    frame as often as you wish. If you create frames that would have same name,
    for example, two copies of the same frame, Protégé automatically appends
    characters (such as _1) at the end of the second copy to ensure the names
    are different in the working ontology.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Click OK.<br>
    The highlighted operation(s) are performed. The To Do list at the <a href="suggestions.htm">Suggestions Tab</a>,
    the <a href="conflicts_tab.htm">Conflicts Tab</a>, and the <a href="result_window.htm">Result Window</a>
    are all updated accordingly. If you view any of the other tabs, such as the
    Classes tab, the frame incorporated by your operation will be visible.</li>
