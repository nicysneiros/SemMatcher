<p>You can configure PROMPT's behavior using the PROMPT Configuration
dialog.&nbsp;</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/config1.gif" width="307" height="183"></p>

<p align="left">To change PROMPT configuration:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Select <b>Configure</b> from the <b>Prompt</b> menu. This
    menu appears to the right of the other menus when you enable PROMPT.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">To change the way PROMPT handles slots when you copy or
    merge a class, check <b>Consider inherited slots</b>. In general, classes
    have two kinds of slots: slots that are directly attached to a class and
    inherited slots. If <b>Consider inherited slots</b> is not selected, then
    each time you copy or merge a class, PROMPT only copies direct slots. If <b>Consider
    inherited slots</b> is selected, PROMPT also copies any inherited slots.</li>
  <li>
    <p>To change whether or not frame names that are the same
    except for capitalization should be considered to be identical, check <b>Case
    sensitive ontology</b>. If this item is selected, frames that differ only in
    their capitalization are considered to be different.&nbsp;If this item is
    deselected, frames that have the same spelling but different capitalization
    are considered to have the same name. In this case, frames with the
    &quot;same&quot; name may show up at the <a href="conflicts_tab.htm">Conflicts</a>
    tab.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;When <a href="merge_mode.htm">merging</a> ontologies,
    to set one of the source ontologies as &quot;preferred&quot; for names,
    documentation strings, or roles, click <b>Set preferred ontology</b> and
    select the ontology you want from the menu. Normally, when you are merging
    two frames with different names, documentation strings, or roles (that is,
    different own slot values), PROMPT asks you to choose the value for the
    merged class. Setting an ontology as &quot;preferred&quot; tells PROMPT to
    automatically choose the name, documentation, and role of the frame that
    comes from the preferred ontology. Note that the ontology that is selected
    at the time that the operation is performed is the one that is used. This
    allows you to choose a different preferred ontology for different parts of
    the merge. For example, suppose you had two patient database ontologies, one
    of which was better structured for personal and billing information, and the
    other of which was better structured for medical history and medications.
    You could set the first one as the default and incorporate the personal
    information, then change the default to the second, without changing the
    frames you had already incorporated, and then continue your merge,
    incorporating the medical history.</li>
</ol>
<p align="left"><b>Note:</b> PROMPT configuration can only take place after you
have enabled PROMPT and chosen your source ontologies. To learn about enabling
PROMPT by selecting <b>Configure</b> from the <b>Project</b> menu, see <a href="activate_prompt.htm">Enabling
the Prompt Tab</a>.</p>
