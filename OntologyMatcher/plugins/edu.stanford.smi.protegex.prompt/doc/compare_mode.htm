<p>Compare mode is a view-only mode that allows you to compare two different
versions of the same ontology. It provides a list of frames that are unchanged,
and attempts to identify which frames have been changed, and what they now
correspond to.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Note: </b>If you are familiar with programming environments such as UNIX, note that the functionality
of compare mode is similar to
comparison tools such as the UNIX tool <code>diff</code>, but is based on the ontological structure of the project,
rather than the line-by-line difference between the files.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Like merge, compare uses a number of heuristics to make a best guess as to
changes and correspondences. In this
case, the heuristics behind the standard PROMPT merge can be modified. When
the two projects to be merged are known to be different versions of the same
ontology,
Prot&eacute;g&eacute; can use stronger heuristics, suggesting, for example, that
a single unmatched sibling of the same parent in the two different versions may
be the same frame with a different name.&nbsp; By concentrating on the differences between two similar projects (rather
than the similarities of two different projects as in merge), compare can give
much better results for the type of reconciliation required in version
control.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For compare mode, the Prompt tab consists of a single window, the Image
table, which shows all the frames in the two compared projects and lists the
similarities and differences. See <a href="image_table.htm">the Image Table</a>
topic for further information.</p>
