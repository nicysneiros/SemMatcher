Merge mode allows you to take two existing Prot&eacute;g&eacute; ontologies and
create a new ontology which combines them, while merging similar or identical
frames. The original ontologies are left untouched.&nbsp;
<p>Merge is useful when you have two independent ontologies which have some
overlap, possibly with different names or structures, and you want to combine
them into a single, larger ontology. When merging, for each of the two
ontologies, you can choose whether or not to incorporate the entire ontology
into the target project. If you only want to include a part, merge mode will
help you determine which frames you need for completeness and consistency.&nbsp;</p>
<p> You can use merge to incorporate two additional ontologies into an existing
project. By changing the ontologies specified on the ontology menus, you can,
for example, merge two classes that are in the working ontology.&nbsp;</p>
<p> You can extend this to use merge mode simply to combine frames in an existing
project. For example, you could create two empty projects to use as dummy sources for the merge, and
then enable merge mode and use the merging functionality to combine frames in your existing
project. &nbsp;</p>
<p> Examples and descriptions in the help files are given for a new, empty
project.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In merge mode, the <a href="prompt_tab.htm">Prompt Tab</a> has three subtabs:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The Suggestions Tab</li>
      <li>The Conflicts Tab</li>
      <li>The New Operations Tab
      </li>
    </ul>
<p>Via these tabs, PROMPT guides you through the merging process making
suggestions, identifying conflicts, and proposing conflict-resolution
strategies.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The Suggestions Tab</h2>
<p><a href="suggestions.htm">The Suggestions Tab</a> contains a list of
suggested <a href="operations.htm">operations</a>. At the first stage, merge suggestions
are based solely on the
linguistic similarity of the frame names. Using your knowledge of the source
ontologies, you can create, edit, remove, and perform suggestions on the list.
As you make changes, PROMPT considers the structure of the ontology around the arguments to
the latest operations and proposes other operations that you should perform. For
example, if you have merged two classes, creating a new class which combines all
of their slots, PROMPT may suggest merging similar slots as well.</p>
<p>The possible merge operations are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>merge two similar frames from the source ontologies</li>
  <li>copy a frame from one of the source ontologies, usually a frame that has
    no analog in the other ontology</li>
  <li> remove one of the superclasses of a class; you may need to do this to break a cycle in the
    hierarchy</li>
</ul>
<p>Frames that have been merged or copied are marked with a mapped <img border="0" src="images/Mapped.gif" width="15" height="16">
icon in <a href="result_window.htm">The Result Window</a> and <a href="source_bases.htm">The Source Knowledge Bases Window</a>.</p>
<h2>The Conflicts Tab</h2>
<p><a href="conflicts_tab.htm">The Conflicts Tab</a> contains a list of conflicts that have arisen because of operations you
have performed. Each time you perform an operation, PROMPT determines any conflicts the
operation may have caused in the merged ontology and proposes possible solutions to the
conflicts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you first start a merge, the Conflicts tab is empty. When conflicts
arise, the tab name
is highlighted in red.</p>
<h2>The New Operations Tab</h2>
<p><a href="new_operations.htm">The New Operations Tab</a> is a working area
that shows your source ontologies and allows you to
create new operations. Icons show which frames from the source ontologies have
already been incorporated into the working project.</p>
