<p>Once you have <a href="activate_prompt.htm">enabled</a> your project to
use the Prompt tab, you can merge, extract, include, or compare projects by
initializing the tab.&nbsp;For merge, extract, and compare, Protégé works on a
copy of each project you select, leaving the original ontology and source files
unchanged. If you are moving frames from an included to an including project,
the projects are not changed at this point; however, both projects will be
altered later, when you actually save the working project after you have moved
selected frames.</p>
<p>To initialize PROMPT:</p>
<ol>
  <li>If you have created a new project, and you have not yet saved it, save it before <i> </i>you initialize PROMPT. This will tell PROMPT where to
    store its log.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Click the Prompt tab. If the Prompt Tab displays a window with subtabs and
    options, then it has already been initialized. If the Prompt tab does not appear, you need to
    enable PROMPT in your project first. See <a href="activate_prompt.htm">Enabling
    the Prompt Tab</a>
    for more information.<br>
    <img border="0" src="images/initial1gif.gif" width="147" height="46"></li>
  <li>Click anywhere in the Prompt Tab area to initialize PROMPT.&nbsp;<br>
    The Open dialog box is displayed.<br>
    <img border="0" src="images/initial_open.gif" width="488" height="263"></li>
  <li>Select the desired operation from the pull down menu.<br>
    <img border="0" src="images/initial_menu.gif" width="462" height="82"></li>
  <li>Click the <img border="0" src="images/Add.gif" width="19" height="19"> button(s) to select the
    file(s) you want to use. For <a href="merge_mode.htm"> merge</a> and <a href="compare_mode.htm">compare</a>
    modes, you need to select two
    files. For <a href="extract_mode.htm"> extract</a> and <a href="move_frames_mode.htm">move
    frames</a> modes, you need to select one file. See the descriptions of each
    mode for more information.</li>
  <li>To help you keep track of your ontologies, Protégé attaches a suffix to
    each frame in the projects you pull in. This suffix, the &quot;Alias&quot;,
    that indicates the source project of the frame. By default, it is usually
    the name of the original project, except in the case of compare, where the
    two files are called &quot;old&quot; and &quot;new&quot;.&nbsp; To edit this
    suffix, simply edit the text in the <b>Alias</b> entry box. Note that once
    you have finished making all the changes in your project, you can remove
    suffixes using the Prompt menu.</li>
  <li>If you are merging large ontologies (several thousand frames each), you can disable the <b>Compare
    sources</b> option. Normally, if you have selected merge, Protégé will
    load all the frames from both ontologies into your working memory. For
    most merges, this default behavior is&nbsp; the best option. However, if the
    original ontologies are extremely large, this can be very expensive,
    consuming a lot of resources. You can limit the scope of the merge by deselecting the <b>Compare
    sources</b> option. This option is valuable if Protégé hangs during your merge.</li>
  <li>Once you have made all your selections, click OK to initialize PROMPT.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<p>Once PROMPT has been initialized, Protégé loads the appropriate
information from the source files and prepares its suggestions. The Prompt tab
changes to reflect the choices you made during initialization.</p>
