<strong>WordNet Tab</strong><br><br>

The WordNet tab allows you to search <a href="http://www.cogsci.princeton.edu/~wn/">WordNet</a> and annotate your
Prot&eacute;g&eacute; ontology with terms, concept IDs, synonyms, relations, and other information from WordNet.  The WordNet 
Tab is an implementation of the Remote KB Tab (see also UMLS tab). In WordNet, English nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs 
are organized into 
synonym sets, each representing one underlying lexical concept. Different relations link the synonym sets. The WordNet tab is
a customized interface for viewing WordNet knowledge base remotely within Prot&eacute;g&eacute;. It allows the user to annotate 
an ontology in Prot&eacute;g&eacute; directly with information from WordNet database, search sources by name, and create new 
Prot&eacute;g&eacute; classes and instances with WordNet content.<br><br>
