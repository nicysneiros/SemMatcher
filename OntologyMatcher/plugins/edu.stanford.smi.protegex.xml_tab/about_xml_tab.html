<strong>XML Tab</strong><br><br>

The XML Tab is one of a series of tabs (along with the UMLS Tab and 
the OKBC Tab) designed to make it easier to use Prot&eacute;g&eacute; as a 
component in a larger knowledge-based systems development strategy. It enables a developer to import an 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/XML/">XML</a> document into Prot&eacute;g&eacute;, creating a set of classes 
and instances in a knowledge-base which correspond to the entries in the XML document. And it enables a Prot&eacute;g&eacute; 
knowledge-base to be saved as an XML document, easily publishable on the world-wide web. Thus, for example, a knowledge-base 
developer could use the OKBC Tab to import a knowledge base from 
<a href="http://ontolingua.stanford.edu/">Ontolingua</a>, add in some terms using the 
UMLS tab and then save the resulting knowledge-base in XML.<br><br>

The XML Tab is set as an extra tab on a domain project. It provides the user with 
the ability to select files, view their contents, and save portions of the knowledge base on the left-hand side. The user 
can select part of the knowledge base and store it out to XML without leaving the tab.<br><br>
